        <h1> For you</h1>
        <p>Happy Birthday, My Love Soodha ❤️
   Today is as special to me as you are.
It’s your birthday, and we’ve completed 5 beautiful years together — five years of love, laughter, small fights, understanding, and growing stronger every single day.

I feel truly blessed to have you in my life, Soodha.
Your smile is my favorite thing, and your happiness is my biggest priority.

I wish that this new year of your life brings you all the joy, peace, success, and love you deserve — just like the happiness you’ve given me over the years.

I love you more than words can ever explain, Soodha.
Happy Birthday, my heart! ❤️🎉🎂 </p>
